30. Custom Python Interpreters
******************************

The modules described in this chapter allow writing interfaces similar
to Python’s interactive interpreter.  If you want a Python interpreter
that supports some special feature in addition to the Python language,
you should look at the "code" module.  (The "codeop" module is lower-
level, used to support compiling a possibly-incomplete chunk of Python
code.)

The full list of modules described in this chapter is:

* 30.1. "code" — Interpreter base classes

  * 30.1.1. Interactive Interpreter Objects

  * 30.1.2. Interactive Console Objects

* 30.2. "codeop" — Compile Python code
